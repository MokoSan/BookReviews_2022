## The Book In 3 Sentences

Parmahansa Yogananda presents a rare account of his very unique life as an Indian monk elucidating on his supernatural experiences with other Yogis and promulgating the practice of meditation and Kriya Yoga. The Sacred Guru-Disciple relationship, law of karma and the unwritten law for the truth seeker being patience are the three main lessons expounded on. Yoga and meditation is the solution to all problems.

## My 411

Autobiography of a Yogi is my favorite book of all time and I am happy to have finished my 11th annual pilgrimage to the mind of Parmahansa Yogananda. There is no other autobiography that makes me laugh as hard,  leaves me in goosebumps and a state of wonder - every other one wanes in comparison. Every single time I have read this book, there is a sense of peace during the hypnogogic state  each time I put the book down after my nightly reading as I drift off to a comfortable place. I learn something new from this book every time I read it - whether it is vocabulary or contextualization of the lessons based on my state of mind at the time. 

I am incredibly lucky to have moved only a 20 minute drive from the Self Realization Center in Encinitas and today, 5th of March, I visited the meditation gardens. Perfect timing after finishing this book!
