## The Book In 3 Sentences

In the Psychology of Money, Morgan Housel highlights how success with finance is more to do with how you behave rather than your psychology and you can make smarter financial decisions by saving, acknowledging the compounding effect and knowing what game you are playing and making sure you aren't playing someone else's game. Instead of pretending that humans are ROI-optimizing machines, he shows you how your psychology can work for and against you. The main purpose of acquiring wealth is to be independent i.e. the highest form of wealth is to wake up every morning and and say, "I can do whatever I want today".

## My 411

This book is incredibly well written insomuch as I read half of it in one sitting after I picked it up. Chapters flow well into each other and the book contains a good mix of psychological lessons and financial concepts. Wisdom laden aphorisms were my favorite part.

## Notes

### Summary

__1. Go out of your way to find humility when things are going right and forgiveness/compassion when they go wrong.__

Because it’s never as good or as bad as it looks. The world is big and complex. Luck and risk are both real and hard to identify. Do so when judging both yourself and others. Respect the power of luck and risk and you’ll have a better chance of focusing on things you can actually control. You’ll also have a better chance of finding the right role models.

__2. Less ego, more wealth__

Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don’t see. So wealth is created by suppressing what you could buy today in order to have more stuff or more options in the future. No matter how much you earn, you will never build wealth unless you can put a lid on how much fun you can have with your money right now, today.

__3. Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night.__

That’s different from saying you should aim to earn the highest returns or save a specific percentage of your income. Some people won’t sleep well unless they’re earning the highest returns; others will only get a good rest if they’re conservatively invested. To each their own. But the foundation of, “does this help me sleep at night?” is the best universal guidepost for all financial decisions.

__4. If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon.__

Time is the most powerful force in investing. It makes little things grow big and big mistakes fade away. It can’t neutralize luck and risk, but it pushes results closer towards what people deserve.

__5. Become OK with a lot of things going wrong.__

You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes. No matter what you’re doing with your money you should be comfortable with a lot of stuff not working. That’s just how the world is. So you should always measure how you’ve done by looking at your full portfolio, rather than individual investments. It is fine to have a large chunk of poor investments and a few outstanding ones. That’s usually the best-case scenario. Judging how you’ve done by focusing on individual investments makes winners look more brilliant than they were, and losers appear more regrettable than they should.

__6. Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness.__

The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in finance.

__7. Be nicer and less flashy__

No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are. You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch. But what you probably want is respect and admiration. And you’re more likely to gain those things through kindness and humility than horsepower and
chrome.

__8. Save. Just Save.__

You don’t need a specific reason to save. It’s great to save for a car, or a downpayment, or a medical emergency. But saving for things
that are impossible to predict or define is one of the best reasons to save.  Everyone’s life is a continuous chain of surprises. Savings that aren’t earmarked for anything in particular is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment.

__9. Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it__

Because nothing worthwhile is free. And remember that most financial costs don’t have visible price tags. Uncertainty, doubt, and regret are common costs in the finance world. They’re often worth paying. But you have to view them as fees (a price worth paying to get something nice in exchange) rather than fines (a penalty you should avoid).

__10. Worship room for error__

A gap between what could happen in the future and what you need to happen in the future in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding magic over time. Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if it keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times over.

__11. Avoid the extreme ends of financial decisions__

Everyone’s goals and desires will change over time, and the more extreme your past decisions were the more you may regret them as you evolve.

__12. You should like risk because it pays off over time__

But you should be paranoid of ruinous risk because it prevents you from taking future risks that will pay off over time.

__13. Define the game you’re playing, and make sure your actions are not being influenced by people playing a different game.__

__14. Respect the mess__

Smart, informed, and reasonable people can disagree in finance, because people have vastly different goals and desires. There is no single right answer; just the answer that works for you.

5. __Getting Wealth vs. Staying Wealthy__

    8. Survival Mindset

          1. Compounding doesn't rely on earning big returns. Merely good returns sustained uninterrupted for the longest period of time - especially in times of chaos and havoc - will always win.
       2. __Planning is important, but the important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan__
          1. A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone's reality.
          2. Emphasis of room for error is KEY.

      1. Index funds operate in a similar way.

   5. We underestimate how normal it is for a lot of things fail.

   1. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are.
   2. Paradox: people tend to want to signal to others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don't think wealth is admirable, but because they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired.
   3. People generally aspire to be respected and admired by others, and using money to buy fancy things may bring less of it than you imagine.

        2.  Pessimists extrapolate present trends without accounting for how markets adapt.
            1.  Iron Law in Economics: Extremely good and extremely bad circumstances rarely stay that way for long because supply and demand adapt in hard-to-predict ways.
        3.  Progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.

18. __When You'll Believe Anything__
    1.  Appealing fictions, and why stories are more powerful than statistics.
    2.  The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true aka Confirmation Bias.
        1.  The bigger the gap between what you want to be true and what you need to be true to have an acceptable outcome, the more you are protecting yourself from falling victim to an appealing financial fiction.
        2.  There is no greater force in finance that room for error, and the higher the stakes, the wider it should be.
    3.  Everyone has an incomplete view of teh world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps.
        1.  Most people don't know about things they don't know. 
        2.  Coming to terms with how much you don't know means coming to terms with how much of what happens in the world is out of your control. And that can be hard to accept.
        3.  The illusion of control is more persuasive than the reality of uncertainty.

21. __Postscript: A Brief History of Why the US Consumer Thinks The Way They DO__
    1.  August, 1945: World War 2 Ends
        1.  3 forces had built up during the war:
            1.  Housing construction ground to a halt as production capacity was all military based.
            2.  Specific new jobs were created during the war such as building ships, tanks and planes.
            3.  Marriage rate spiked during and immediately after as soldiers didn't want to return to their mother's basement.
        2.  Pessimism all around and the fear was exacerbated by the fact that exports couldn't be immediately relied upon for growth from Europe and Japan than lay in ruins.
    2.  Low Interest Rates and the Intentional Birth of the American Consumer
        1.  To keep the economy afloat, interest rates were kept low.
        2.  An era of encouraging thrift and saving to fund the war quickly turned into an era of actively promoting spending.
        3.  Things were made cheap and money was pumped in.
    3.  Pent up demand for stuff fed by a credit boom and a hidden 1930s productivity boom led to an economic boom
        1.  1950s people realized: "Wow, we have some amazing new inventions" and the money to pay for it. 
        2.  Huge surge in commercial spending feeding this pent up demand.
    4.  Gains are shared more equally than before
        1.  The defining characteristic of economics in the 1950s is that the country got rich by making the rich richer and the poor less poor. 
        2.  "The rich man smokes the same sort of cigarettes as the poor man".
    5.  Debt rose tremendously. But so did incomes, so the impact wasn't a big deal.
        1.  America was booming and booming _together_ like never before.
    6.  Things start cracking
        1. 1973 recession
        2. Everything in finance is data within the context of expectations and expectations always move slower than facts.
        3. Growth became more uneven yet expectation of people's lifestyle should compare to their peers remained the same.
    7. The boom resumes, but it's different than before
       1. Reagan's America there was a jump however, there was a sharp inequality due to a small group of Americans earning more than others.
    8. The big stretch
       1. More debt, more disparity.
       2. The beginning of the stretch took place after people started taking on more debt than they can service.
    9. Once a paradigm is in place, it is difficult to turn it around
       1.  Debt was shed after 2008, which was a result of low interest rates as a result of 9/11.
       2.  But the mentality still remained of equality and of consumer culture that had been forced in starting post-World War 2.
    10. The Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, Brexit and Donald Trump each represents a group shouting "Stop the ride, I want off"
